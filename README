dbc_browser is a WoW DBC reader written in php.

All data is read from SQL tables. A dump of some dbc files is needed
(provided) and a MaNGOS world database, that can be obtained from:
http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/ytdbase/

Install instructions:

- copy/symlink the src directory into your web root
- create a new database and run the dump file 'sql/dbc_335.sql'
- install the world database (if you don't have one)
- edit the 'config.php' file to match your database settings
